# Welcome

I am a final-year Computer Science student with a deep interest in cybersecurity. Over the past two years, I’ve spent my time outside of class building a practical foundation in offensive security, moving from solving labs to understanding how real networks are secured.

### My Background

While my university coursework gave me a strong computer science base, my passion for security led me to pursue the HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS). Passing this exam was a major milestone for me. It was a rigorous, multi-day assessment that taught me the importance of patience, methodology, and clear reporting.

### What I Bring to the Table

I don’t just rely on automated tools. I enjoy the process of understanding how systems work (and break) at a deeper level.

* **Network Security:** I have experience navigating simulated corporate networks (like the "Dante" Pro Lab), which helped me understand how different systems interact in a business environment.
* **Problem Solving:** I enjoy the challenge of finding vulnerabilities in web applications and figuring out the logic behind them.
* **Communication:** I know that finding a bug is only half the job. I focus on writing clear, readable reports because I believe security is about helping people fix problems, not just finding them.

### What I’m Looking For

I am currently seeking an entry-level opportunity as a Junior Penetration Tester or Security Analyst. I am eager to join a professional team where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced mentors, and contribute to securing real-world environments.
